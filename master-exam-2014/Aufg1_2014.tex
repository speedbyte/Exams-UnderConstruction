The real time image in the controller is based on the sensor values. The sensors have their own bottlenecks with respect to time because of the conversion of the physical entities into the digital entities. These digital values are sent to the controller which would calculate the set point and send the value back to the actuator.

\item What are the two kinds of RT images based on the above constellation?
\item What is the relation between the temporal accuracy, execution times and the update period for both kinds of images?
\item In case the update period is not sufficient to update the RT image in the controller within the temporal accuracy period, how can this be achieved?
