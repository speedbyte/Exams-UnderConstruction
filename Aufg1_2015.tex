A system designer has been assigned a task to calculate the MTTF of human beings. To achieve this,

    Subject are human beings. Since we want to calculate the life time of human beings, we would leave the
    time factor in years.
    Total number of failures = 625 \\
    Total number of years under test = 50*10$^{4}$ * 1 \\
    $\lambda$ = Total number of failures / Total number or years under test = 0.00125 failures / year \\

    MTTF = $\lambda$ = 800 years. This means that the mean time to failure is 800 years. \\

		--------------\\
		The approach used by the system designer is not realistic, because the task is to calculate the MTTF of human beings and not the MTTF of human 
    beings those are 25 years old. Due to wear and tear of the body, the MTTF of other ages would reduce and hence the MTTF of the entire human cycle would
    reach a realistic number.

    .1\\
		--------------\\
Main characteristics of a communication channel are\\
	\textbf{Bandwidth}\\
Bandwidth indicates the number of bits that can be transmitted over a communication channel per unit time (typically described in bit/s). The bandwidth is limited by physical characteristics of the channel. For example, an unshielded twisted pair channel in a car may transmit up to 1 Mbit/s, limited by EMI constraints. A single wire channel in the same environment may only be able to transmit 10 kbit/s. An optical channel is not constrained by EMI, and can transmit many GBit/s.\\
	\textbf{Propagation delay}\\
Propagation delay is the time interval it takes for a bit to travel from one end of the channel to the other.
It is determined by the physical length of the channel and the transmission speed (electromagnetic, optical) within the channel. In vacuum, an electromagnetic wave travels at about 300.000 km/s, or 30 cm/ns. In typical cables, the transmission speed is lower than that in vacuum, about 2/3 of that value. To travel across a length of 1 km, it takes a signal about 5 $\mu$s; or it travels 20 cm/ns.\\
    .2\\
		--------------\\
    Propagation delay = Bit packet / Bandwidth = Length / Speed of communication \\
    Bandwidth = Bit packet * Speed of Communication / Length \\ 
		.\\
    Bandwidth with 100 byte packet = $\frac{100 * 8 * 2 * 10^{8}}{2000}$ = 80 Mbps \\
    Bandwidth with 512 byte packet = $\frac{512 * 8 * 2 * 10^{8}}{2000}$= 409.6 Mbps

Assuming that the start up sequence of the infotainment unit in a car depends on a CAN message sent by the central unit.
Please answer the following questions using timing formulas:

\begin{unteraufgaben}

\item  Given the maximum and minimum communication delay in a system with a local time base, how long after receiving the 
message from the central unit should the infotainment unit wait until the received message can be declared permament?

\item Assuming the above system with a global time base of granularity much smaller than the local time base, how is the  
startup time affected? Please explain your answer.

\node[below right, text width=17 cm] at (rect.north west) {
    \lsg{
    .1\\
		--------------\\
    As the time calculated should be "after" the message has been received at the infotainment unit, we have to 
    ignore the propagation delay of the message. Thus the message can be declared permanent at the infotainment unit
    when $d_{max}$ + $d_{max}$ - $d_{min}$ + $g_{l}$ time has passed.\\
    .2\\
		--------------\\
   	Since 2g << $g_{l}$, and again ignoring the propagation delay as we are concerned about the time to wait after the
   	message has been received at the infotainment unit, then time to wait for message to become permanent is \\ 
   	$t_{send}$ + $d_{max}$ + 2g \\
   	Comparing the above two formulas, we find that the time to wait reduces significantly by using a global time base.

Calculated correction value can be applied to local time immediately (state correction), or rate of clock can be modified such that the clock speeds up or slows down to bring it into better agreement with rest of ensemble (rate correction).\\
State correction leads to a discontinuity in the time base. If time is set back, the same time is reached again. This can cause nasty errors. Rate correction is therefore preferable.

What is the membership service in the TTP/C protocol? Explain its purpose and briefly explain how it works.

\begin{tikzpicture}

\node[below right, text width=17 cm] at (rect.north west) {
    \lsg{
\textbf{The Membership Service}\\
The membership field of a node contains one bit for each cluster node. If one out of the redundant messages is received by a receiving node, the receiving node considers the sender node operational at this membership point.\\
The node is considered operational until its next membership point in the following TDMA cycle. If a node fails within this interval, the failure is only recognized at the next membership point. Thus, the delay of the membership information is at most one TDMA cycle.
If none of the expected messages arrives with a correct CRC, then a receiver considers the sending node as failed and clears the membership bit of the sender at the end of the current SRU slot.\\
If a particular node did not receive any correct message from a sending node, e.g., because the incoming link of the receiver has failed, it assumes that this sending node has crashed, and it eliminates it from its membership vector at the end of the current SRU slot.\\
If, however, all other nodes received at least of one these messages they come to a different conclusion about the membership. This creates two cliques that cannot communicate with each other because they contain a different C-state (the membership vector is part of the C-state). \\
TTP contains a mechanism which let the majority view in such a conflict situation, i.e., the node with the failed input port, which is in the majority, is removed from the membership. Before sending a message, a node counts its negative CRC results during the last TDMA round. If more than half of the messages received have been discarded because of a failed CRC, the node assumes that its C-state differs from the majority, terminates its operation and thus leaves membership.\\
This mechanism avoids clique formation among the nodes of the ensemble. Agreement on membership is thus bound to indirect acknowledgement of message reception by the majority.\\
