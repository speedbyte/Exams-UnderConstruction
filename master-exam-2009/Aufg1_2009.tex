An RT entity changes its value periodically according to 
\begin{displaymath} 
y(t) = A_{0}.\sin(2\pi ft) 
\end{displaymath} 
with amplitude $A_{0}$ and frequency f . What is the maximum permissible frequency $f_{max}$ for the entity value if the entity is sampled with a period of $T_{sample}$ = 1 msec, and the maximum change of value
between two sampling points should never exceed 0.1\% of the full range value?

Given are four tasks which access resources (A,B,C):
$\tau$ 1 (r 0 = 10, C = 4, Prio=4; [A;1]), where the task executes for two time units, and then requests
the resource A.
$\tau$ 2 (r 0 = 7, C = 4, Prio=3; [A;1][B;1]), where the task executes for one time unit, and then
requests the resource A, and thereafter B.
$\tau$ 3 (r 0 = 4, C = 4, Prio=2; [B;1][C;1]), where the task executes for one time unit, and then
requests the resource B, and thereafter C.
$\tau$ 4 (r 0 = 4, C = 4, Prio=1; [A;5[B;2]][C;1]), where the task executes for two time units, then
requests the resource A, holds it for one time unit, and then makes a nested request for resource
B, and then requests C.
Notation: r 0 is the release or request time, C is the execution time, Prio is the priority of the tasks
(higher number means higher priority). [A;5] means request to resource A for five time units.
[A;a[B;b]] means a nested critical sections, where the usage of A includes in turn the usage of B,
and time a includes time b.
This task set shall be scheduled with two different resource access protocols.
3.1 Construct the schedule for this task set using the priority inheritance protocol. Use the the
diagram furnished below. On the first four lines draw the schedule of each task as if there
were no other tasks. On the last line, draw the resulting schedule. Do not use a different
diagram template.

3.2  Construct the schedule for this task set using the priority ceiling protocol. On the first
four lines draw the schedule of each task as if there were no other tasks. On the last
line, draw the resulting schedule. Use the diagram provided below. Do not use your own
diagram templates


3.3 Take a look at another periodic task set with periods Ti and the following parameters:
Is it possible to create a schedule that meets all deadlines using the rate monotonic
algorithm (RMA)? Please explain.

3.4  Construct the schedule (mark using X) for the task set above and priority driven RMA into
the table below (two lines, second table is continuation of first table):

3.5 For the task set given in 3.3 consider the context switch time (the time it takes to
switch from execution of one task to another). This time shall take 0.8 time units, including
the start of the first job. Is it possible to create a valid schedule under these conditions?
Please explain.
